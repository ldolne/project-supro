Here's a link to the final product: [Project Supro](https://ldolne.github.io/project-supro/ "Project Supro").


## Project Description

This project has been ordered by web designer John Lafrite for his client Supro, a fashion company. Supro wanted to improve their presence on the web and John Lafrite was charged with designing a website that met their desires. Our mission was to build the front-end integration. John Lafrite provided us with the design, which we followed strictly, adding hover effects and animations where suited.


## Project Structure

The website that we built is an e-shop which presents the company's products.

These are the different pages on the website :

* Homepage
* Shop page
* Single product page
* About page
* Contact page


## Project Chronology

The Lamami startup started working on this project on May 26, 2020 and delivered the final product on June 4, 2020.

### Release Notes

## Project Techonology

To build this project, we used mainly HTML5 and CSS3 markup languages. We used a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and speeded up the CSS by using SASS. We followed John Lafrite's design.

Icons and images are coming from different free ressources. Here are some of them:
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com "Font Awesome")
* [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com "Ion Icons")
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com "Google Fonts")
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.be/maps "Google Maps")
* [Animate.css](https://animate.style/ "Animate.css")
